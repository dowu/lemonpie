# Lemonpie

Lemonpie is a tiny **SCSS base package**. It contains frequently used **variables**, **mixins** to optimize workflows as well as a **browser reset**. You can use all of them together by importing ``lemonpie.scss`` or you can import single files.


## Installation

To install the Lemonpie package, just hit the following in your terminal:

```bash
$ npm install lemonpie
```

## Configuration

Import ``lemonpie.scss`` in your **main SCSS file** with the line below for the whole experience:

```css
@import "~node_modules/lemonpie/lemonpie.scss";
```

> You can also import every single file for it's own if you don't need the whole package. You can access them via ``/core``
